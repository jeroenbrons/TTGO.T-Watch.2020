# My-TTGO-Watch

A smartwatch based on ESP32 from LilyGo. Currently support for T-Watch2020 V1, V2 and V3.

## Warning

This repository only represents the state of my own T-Watch. I will implement some apps that are very specific for my needs and will also disabled apps that I personally don't need. Maybe you find something interesting and maybe I'll create a PR for some apps I might create in the future, but currently nothing concrete is planned.

For a better start for your own TTGO T-Watch, use the repository I forked from: https://github.com/sharandac/My-TTGO-Watch
